            <ul>
                <li>The Finals is a FPS multiplayer title developed by Embark Studios.</li>
                <li>The Finals is themed after a game show, with players customizing contestants and competing for cash across wide-scale destructible arenas.</li>
                <li>The Finals is also available on PC, XBOX & PLAYSTATION 5.</li>

            What You Need To Know
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Finals is an FPS team-based multiplayer game with environmental destruction. What makes The Finals stand out?

        <p>
            After playing The Finals for dozens of hours the game separates itself with a gameshow-infused style and destructible arenas. The game is a 3v3v3 gun battles. You and two teammates face off against another three-person squad with different builds in a virtual gameshow, competing to see who can be the first to score enough cash before time runs out. With live sports-style play-by-play announcers to give it that over-the-top, American Gladiators feel that people in the ‘80s thought was going to be the future of sports. That strikes a great balance of not taking itself too seriously or becoming obnoxious.

            Team Builds
        </h2>
        <p>
            The composition of each team adds even more complexity, which has been added by the Finals' developers, Embark Studios. You can choose between the three "body types" of light, medium, and heavy before a match. These are classes, that have various movement speeds, health bars, weapon rosters, and abilities. Light class are speedy, with skills that revolve around stealth and athleticism, with weapons like suppressed SMGs and sawed-off shotguns. Medium class play a supporting role, able to quickly heal and revive teammates, and deploy defensive structures like turrets. Heavy class are all about dealing and absorbing damage, wielding sledgehammers and big machine guns while putting down deployable cover.

            The Finals also have “Events” in every match. Events are gameplay modifiers featured in every match. Events appear towards the second half of a match and last for several minutes, modifying core mechanics and gameplay rules. These events are:

            Game Modes
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Finals also offers different game modes like <i>Cash Out</i>, <i>Terminal Attack</i>, <i>Power Shift</i>, and <i>Bank It</i>, but the one you'll probably play most is World Tour Tournament (Rank Game), The Tournament consists of 8 teams (24 players) in a bracket set up. These teams will compete for 3 rounds, with the top two teams qualifying from each match. And every match the vault can be "stolen" by another team at any point, whether you're waiting for it to initially unlock, transferring to the cashpoint, or during the cash out process. The result is a rolling game of attack and defense, with the vault constantly changing hands in frantic three-way battles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final match will see the two teams remaining compete, with the team with the most cash (20,000) taking the victory. Players can gain cash by eliminating their opponents and collecting in cashout stations.

            ESports Potential
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Finals shows massive esports potential. It is a multiplayer-focused game that provides a competitive spin on the “capture the flag” concept a perfect foundation for an esports game. What’s more, the game is already set in a virtual game world.  The game encourages strategic team-based combat, and given the destructibility of the maps, no two games are ever the same. It’s high-octane, has obvious skill requirements, and with the mix of classes available, openly empowers different playstyles. The Finals is a solid contender to be the next big thing in esports. The game is a lot of fun to both play and watch, and with just a little more publicity, the game is likely to attract esports teams, leagues, and investors, propelling it to major tournament status.
