            Have you ever thought about flying through space in your own spaceship? What about landing on a planet and discovering new life forms? With No Man’s Sky, it's possible, at least virtually, to do whatever you want to experience in space. This 2016 game lets you live up to your dreams of exploring the universe through your console or PC. It has come a long way from the year it was released, as it still releases new content today. From taking on missions and fighting in space to gathering resources and building bases, alone or with other players, there is a lot you can do in this game. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

            No Man’s Sky features a procedurally generated world where planets are created using an algorithm based on a set of rules. This makes it so that no two planets you are discovering are alike. This lets the planets have their own unique landscapes and lifeforms. Whatever you see in the world can be explored, making the universe open to endless possibilities. It is up to you to experience it and play in any way you like, whether it be taking on missions or just gazing at the beautiful planet and deciding to build a new base to settle for a while. It might be overwhelming to some, but that’s the point since the universe is supposed to be vast and overwhelming. The important thing is to take it one step at a time and take your time to learn if you ever decide to play the game. The experience is what makes it worth it.

            Surviving the Frontier Alone or With Another Player
        </h2>
        <p>
            No Man’s Sky features more than just exploration, as danger lurks everywhere. The game has a survival aspect that includes resource management while facing the harsh environment. The game also features base building using the resources you have gathered to help you survive the planet you are exploring. It is always best to be prepared whenever you are out exploring. Other than building bases and crafting other materials, the resources you collect are also used to trade or sell for better equipment and ships. These upgrades are essential for surviving the harsh universe and progressing through the game. In No Man’s Sky, every victory and defeat has lasting consequences, adding a layer of tension to the exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exploration in No Man’s Sky can be experienced alone or with other players. It is possible to go on intergalactic missions together and explore the vast universe or just visit each other’s bases on different planets. The game offers a shared universe where players can upload their discoveries to a galactic map and makes it possible for others to explore it as well.
