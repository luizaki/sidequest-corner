            The gaming scene has evolved significantly over the past few years, with gacha games emerging as one of the dominant genres in mobile gaming. Gacha game companies generally generate their revenue through the release of a limited number of characters or items in each update or "patch." According to the website Gacha Guru (2024), the top five grossing mobile games, such as <i>Genshin Impact</i>, which alone generated $150 million in revenue as of July 2024, <i>Fate/Grand Order</i> with $110 million, <i>AFK Arena</i> with $95 million, <i>Marvel Strike Force</i> with $85 million, and <i>Arknights</i> with $75 million, demonstrate the profitability of the genre, provided companies can maximize the monetization of their games based on their user base.

            The term "gacha" is derived from "gashapon," which traces back to Tokyo's Taito Ward on February 17, 1965. According to Japan Crate (2022), these capsule machines dispense figurines encased inside plastic capsules. The machine produces an onomatopoeic sound "gacha gacha" as the user turns the wheel, followed by the sound of the capsule dropping, "pon." This concept of obtaining randomized items from a container is one of the core mechanics employed by mobile gacha games.

            The appeal of gacha games lies in their reliance on luck and the rarity of the items or characters at stake. The player base is often divided into two groups: free-to-play users and "whales" (those who spend large amounts of money). This division also creates a sense of urgency and a fear of missing out (FOMO) on acquiring items or characters after their release. Different players have various motivations for participating in gacha pulls. For example, (1) within a friend group, there may be a competitive "bragging rights" contest based on who has the best luck; (2) some players may simply collect items they like; (3) others may want to show off to others by "whaling" (spending money to buy in-game currency to pull for the item); and (4) some free-to-play users derive satisfaction from obtaining rare characters using the in-game currency they’ve saved through diligent gameplay.

            There are also extreme cases that highlight the potential pitfalls of gacha games. According to Elstrom (2016), one man spent a staggering $6,065 to obtain a single healing character, considered a "meta" or "make-or-break" character crucial to making the game easier to play. Another case, reported by the Inquirer (2018), involved a man who spent $70,000 pulling for a character in <i>Fate/Grand Order</i> without his parents' knowledge. These examples illustrate how the volatile nature of the gacha system can lead players to spend excessive amounts in pursuit of certain items or characters, potentially harming their financial well-being. Without self-control, players may fall prey to the gambling aspect of these games, leading to negative consequences in their lives. However, sometimes this does not apply to those with the financial means to spend large amounts.

            In conclusion, from the development of the gacha concept to its evolution in modern times, gacha games have captivated a global audience with their monetized systems. However, the adverse effects on users’ financial and personal lives cannot be ignored.
