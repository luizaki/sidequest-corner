            Sometimes, we feel bored and use our phones to play games. There are millions of games available on mobile, but it can be hard to choose the ones that are fun to play. Here’s a list of games I play whenever I feel bored to keep myself entertained for minutes or hours whether I’m commuting, waiting for my next class, or just looking for something to do.

            Mobile Legends: Bang Bang
        </h2>
        <p>
            Mobile Legends is a 5v5 (5 player vs 5 player) MOBA developed by Moonton. Each player can choose one from 125 heroes with unique skills to use, and each hero has a role to play, it consists of six roles which consist of a tank, mage, marksman, fighter, jungler, and support. The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy turrets and base. It’s a very fun game to kill boredom because it’s fast-paced, and it has game modes where you can rank up or just play for fun with friends. You can meet many players in the game because of its large community and create teams or squads to compete in MCL which is a game mode where players compete with other players to get the mcl championship weekly. Also the game just recently received the “Mobile E sports of the year award” from the E sports awards 2024.

            Honkai: Star Rail
        </h2>
        <p>
            Honkai: Star Rail is a turn based action RPG developed by Hoyoverse. You play as the Trailblazer, exploring the galaxy with the Astral Express and embarking on adventures. It’s a very fun game because you can meet new characters along the way as you progress through the story. You can earn Stellar Jades (the currency used to obtain characters) and other rewards by completing quests and achievements, which you can use to pull for new characters and strategize to build a team to defeat enemy targets. The game also has events for players to discover new lore and get rewards that are available for a limited amount of time.

            Minecraft Pocket Edition
        </h2>
        <p>
            Minecraft Pocket Edition is a mobile version of the PC game developed by Mojang. It features two game modes: Survival and Creative. In Survival mode, you start from scratch, with health and hunger meters, and no items. You collect resources by exploring the map and gathering blocks and materials to craft items for your survival. Creative mode removes the survival aspects and gives you access to all blocks, allowing you to build anything you want and fully unleash your creativity. I recommend playing this game to kill boredom, as you can build anything with your imagination. You can also play multiplayer with friends to collaborate and create something together.

            Roblox
        </h2>
        <p>
            Roblox is an online multiplayer platform where it allows you to play games developed by other players. The game is fun to play because you can interact with other players and play with friends. And there are many games from different genres you can play. Here are some popular games I played in Roblox : Blade-ball, Dress to impress, the Mimic, Murder mystery 2, and many more.

            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
            After exploring the list of games I mentioned, I hoped you found the perfect game that not only kills your boredom but also satisfies your preferences. If not, you can find other games on the Play and App Store that will satisfy your boredom.
