            When people think of video game franchises that have a) been around for a long time and b) have large communities, they'll likely answer with Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, or Pokémon. But I don't think there's a franchise that could be as big as Touhou Project's. With 26 years and counting, this bullet hell game from Japan had built up a history that could rival all the other games I mentioned. Touhou Project and what it is today has placed itself well within the library of internet fan culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look a bit into it, shall we?

        <h2 class="subhead">
            So, what <i>is</i> Touhou Project?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Touhou Project, most commonly shortened to just Touhou, is a bullet hell video game franchise by Team Shanghai Alice. Throughout time, they had also released spin-off fighting games with Twilight Frontier, but it's still most well-known for the bullet hell ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            In case you don't know what bullet hell games are, the name comes from the fact that these games include an enormous amount of bullet-like obstacles the player has to avoid. Do you see all those white spots in the thumbnail above? They're bullets waiting to be dodged. The hell part of the name becomes self-explanatory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, the main games follow a pretty standard format. It always takes place in the same fictional setting, Gensokyo, a land sealed off from the outside world and filled with Japanese mythical creatures known as <i>yōkai</i>. Resident shrine maiden Reimu Hakurei, often the main player character, is usually faced with investigations of these yōkai that may or may not be disrupting the land. The story progresses level-by-level with the bullet hell mechanics and some dialogue sprinkled in.

            How'd the game come to be?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Team Shanghai Alice is just one person named ZUN manning every aspect of the game development process for the mainline series. This includes the programming, the art, the writing and the music. ZUN originally made the first game, subtitled "Highly Responsive to Prayers," as programming practice and a means to publish music. The first five games were made for the PC-9800 while he was in college between 1997 and 1998. After a hiatus from ZUN, graduating and getting work, he returned to the series now made for Windows and what he'd considered a "reboot" for the game's story. As of the writing of this post, there are now 14 additional games and 10 spin-off fighting games.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may now ponder, "This guy really had this series going on for all these years." And yes, he really did, largely thanks to the fandom that was born from it.

            The Touhou Fandom
        </h2>
        <p>
            Every long-running franchise has a fandom. And those fandoms have spawned insane content that you have to wonder, "Are you sure this is for this small game?" But nothing beats that wonder that Touhou's fanbase does. I could show you <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYdOW09TQGzCZtHoPJXs5Ht0RluCIk60l&si=2tYhPqXP9rolkAZh">this anime playlist</a> at the beginning of this post and talk about it from there, and you wouldn't even realise it's a fanmade adaptation of the games. My first real experience with Touhou was a fanmade role-playing game. And, of course, anyone who's even just a little bit deep into internet culture must've come across <a href="https://youtu.be/FtutLA63Cp8">Bad Apple</a>. That shadow art music video, inspired by a remix from Touhou's soundtrack, had sprung various recreations so wildly that this song deserves its own article. Needless to say, Touhou had become way more than one guy and his bullet games.
        </p>
        <p>
            But how? How was it possible for fans to create things that could best a large company's gaming IP? It comes down to ZUN himself, who not only allowed the creation and distribution of these derivative works but also encouraged doing so. His only requirement was a proper attribution to Team Shanghai Alice, and to not crowdfund their projects. <i>Hakurei Shrine Reitaisai</i>, Reitaisai for short, is a near-annual convention for fans to showcase their work, in which ZUN originally participated in distributing trial versions of his games. But he had managed to build a community that could let their creativity reach its highest peaks.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="conclusion">
            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
            I started this post to discuss how large Touhou has become. But I don't think I could properly encapsulate its massiveness. It just goes to show that the passion of one person could make a community just as passionate thanks to his encouragement of creative freedom. And that community puts the games' cute characters, intense gameplay, and incredible music, up to a tenfold. It's a fire burning so brightly it's meant to shine for a long, long time. Touhou Project has existed for quite some time and will continue to persist on the internet for much longer.
